Where has the time gone, it seems to fly so fast
One moment you're having fun, the next its come to pass
Days turn into yesteryear, old friends find their own way
Until the moment you leave, I wish that you would stay

So here's to you, all our friends, surely we will meet again
Don't stay away too long this time
We'll raise a glass, maybe two
And we'll be thinking of you
Until our paths cross again, maybe next time

Let's laugh at the memories, and talk all afternoon
Let's remember the moments that leave us all too soon
We'll smile at the pictures still lingering in our minds
When you're reminiscing, then all you need is time

So here's to you, all our friends, surely we will meet again
Don't stay away too long this time
We'll raise a glass, maybe two
And we'll be thinking of you
Until our paths cross again, maybe next time

Tracing faded photographs, a scrapbooks lonely charm
Pressed flowers and dreams we had, our fingerprint on time
The first moment we ever met, when your eyes met mine
I remember the summers of Dandelion Wine

So here's to you, all our friends, surely we will meet again
Don't stay away too long this time
We'll raise a glass, maybe two
And we'll be thinking of you
Until our paths cross again, maybe next time

So here's to you, all our friends, surely we will meet again
Don't stay away too long this time
We'll raise a glass, maybe two
And we'll be thinking of you
Until our paths cross again, maybe next time
